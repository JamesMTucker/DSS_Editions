# Editions of the Judean Desert Scrolls and Fragments

Â© 2019 James M. Tucker, PhD (Cand.)

This repository gathers together various tools I have developed to assist in the material analysis of ancient Jewish Scrolls, which were discovered in the Dead Sea region. The repository serves the data for my digital editions at [jamesmtucker.com/editions](https://jamesmtucker.com/editions)
