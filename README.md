# Editions of the Judean Desert Scrolls and Fragments

<!-- There are two primary steps to make an edition of the Judean Desert Scrolls (or sometimes called Dead Sea or Qumran Scrolls). Falling under these two primary steps are an assortment of tasks that range in detail and vary with respect to the time required to conduct a sufficient scholarly analysis. Here, "sufficient scholarly analysis" subsumes rigorous philological analysis, but morphs and translates these editorial traditions within a digital framework. Within digital media, it is possible to acheive a very specific level of granularity, but also it is possible to keep an eye towards the forest. In other words, the method described here pushes beyond the boundaries of higher and lower criticism and Neo-Lachmann and New/Material Philology by embracing the advances that are afforded by digital media. The method proposed here does not pretend to acheive objectivity, but rather it provides an objective way to describe the subjective activities involved when making a critical edition. -->

## General Introduction to the Judean Desert Fragments

At the time of their discovery (ca. 1947), the Judean Desert fragments and scrolls were in various states of decomposition and damage. These scrolls sat in caves for over 2000 years in the northwest region of the Dead Sea, known today as <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Dk7FHXwQgjYPbkqd8">Qumran</a>. While the scrolls sat dormant in the caves, the parchment and/or papyrus naturally decomposed. In addition to natural decomposition, other phenonmena were contributing to their fragmentary state. Rodents and insects were eating the leather, people were looting the caves, and elements of nature (wind, rain, humidity) were exacerbating the decompositional processes. Since the scrolls deteroriated, our understanding of the literary contents are limited.

<!-- Thus, the burden falls to any editor to fashion a model of reconstruction, of both the text and parchment (cf. further discussion in my article <a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/dsd/25/3/article-p335_4.xml?rskey=kfWJOl&result=1">here</a>). The following method describes the model I have developed. This method is aimed towards the creation of digital editions, which are not so much a thing, as it is an assortment of algorithms that can aid the study of these ancient Jewish texts. I began to lay the foundations of this method some years ago in two conference presentations:

* Tucker, James M. "Applying (Perhaps Not So) New Methods to Old Texts: A Case Study of the Judaean Desert Isaiah Scrolls." Presented at _Material (New) Philology and the Dead Sea Scrolls_ Copenhagen, 3–5 April 2014 (conference schedule with my notes: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wEgThPpDNknkau6WG4dTesk5SK25e3xyH1lu4QZBlEw/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>);
* and Tucker, James M. "<a href="https://www.academia.edu/7290280/Digital_Editions_of_the_Scrolls_and_Fragments_of_the_Judaean_Desert_Preliminary_Thoughts">Digital Editions of the Scrolls and Fragments of the Judaean Desert: Preliminary Thoughts</a>" Presented at _West Coast Qumran Study Group: Difficult Texts and Digital Tools_. 30 May – 1 June 2014. Portland, OR, 2014).

From these two presentations, I made a proto-type edition of the Isaiah scrolls. A further contributing factor to this prototype edition was the research I did on the Isaiah Scrolls in my Masters Thesis, “<a href="https://www.academia.edu/19635087/Incorporating_Syntax_into_Theories_of_Textual_Transmission_Preliminary_Studies_in_the_Judaean_Desert_Isaiah_Scrolls_Chapter_2_Methodological_Issues_in_the_Transmission_Theories_of_the_Hebrew_Bible_The_Need_for_Historical_Linguistics">Incorporating Syntax into Theories of Textual Transmission: Preliminary Studies in the Judaean Desert Isaiah Scrolls and Fragments</a>.” Trinity Western University, 2014. I emailed this prototype edition (viz., a link to its URL) to Reinhard G. Kratz in Göttingen on 14 April 2014. Prof. Dr. Kratz then forwarded the email to Dr. Shani Tzoref, Dr. Annette Steudel, and Ingo Kottsieper on 23 April 2014. Shani Tzoref, who was working at the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) at the time, would later come to Göttingen to work on a project proposal to create a digital edition of the _Damascus Document_. Tzoref was inspired by and drew on the ideas of my prototype edition, in her, Reinhard G. Kratz, and Peter Porzig's project proposal, _The Damascus Document: A Critical and Digital Edition_. Unfortunately, this proposal was not successful, but the ideas contained therein were later used in the application proposal of _Scripta Qumranica Electronica_ (SQE). SQE was successfully funded at 1.7 million Euros over the course of five years (for additional information see: <a href="https://www.jewishpress.com/news/dead-sea-scrolls-puzzle-pieces-to-be-matched-via-digitizing/2016/02/23/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.goettinger-tageblatt.de/Campus/Goettingen/Goettinger-Forschung-zu-uralten-Qumranrollen">here</a>). In 2015, I was hired by Reinhard G. Kratz and Shani Tzoref to produce critical editions of _Serekh ha-Yaḥad_ (The Rule of the Community) and _The Damascus Document_ in SQE.

The following method has been refined throughout the years, and has significantly influenced the SQE framework. But the following method is my own. In 2014, the question was posed to me: "If you could make editions of the Dead Sea Scrolls in a digital medium, how would they look like and work?" This question inspired the two conference presentations in 2014 (see above). I have continued to reflect on this question throughout the years; I have published aricles and have given lectures addressed on various issues related to the fragmentary status of the scrolls, the textual fluidity among the various copies of the documents, and how the _presentation of the information contributes to how users of an edition will read the text._ Despite having begun to think about the epistemological issues at stake in editing the Dead Sea Scrolls some years ago, my ideas are in constant development and refinement. But the method presented here has played a significant contribution to my own thinking about editorial, philological, linguistic, literary, and bibliographical practices. -->
